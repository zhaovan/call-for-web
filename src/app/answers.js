// What is your relationship to CSS (or other declarative web-languages)? Do you consider yourself a developer, designer, amateur, artist, thinker?

    <h1>i am a dreamer</h1>
    <p>i have always had a love for css and the web. from a young age, 
    i had played many hours of runescape, maplestory, online mmrorpgs where random friends and i would cast many hours into the night wailing away on pixelated monsters. 
    the web, by existence, is an extension of that. 
    the current web is broken. my relationship to css is a love letter in awe.
    we're able to do so many things on the browser that we could never do before.
    css is so powerful, it shapes material. it creates worlds. without it, the web is lifeless and dull.
    </p>
    <p>
        i am constantly learning about it's limitless potential. we're able to make keyframed animations in browser. we're able to make beautiful gradients. we're able to map shaders and colors to 3d gradients,
         make interactive visualizations. i am always learning more about css and how were able to sit and weed among its ever shifting and powerful nature. i believe that everyone should have the power to shape their own sites, their own browsers, and their own lives

//  How does CSS (or other declarative web-languages) manifest in your pratices, can you give some examples of projects where it took a particular role?

 <h1> playing around with css
 </h1>
 <p>
 css manifests constantly in my process. whether that's text manipulation, layout manipulation, or color manipulation to render a screen into an array of sights. I'm always using CSS to think about worldbuilding, 
 and create sites that feel like experiences in it of itself

const answer3 = `<p>I am a poet, amateur illustrator, type designer, and aspiring game developer / visual artist who would love to bring all these together. 
I think that the browser has so much range in it's capabilities and its means to present work to individuals across the world. For a more fuller list of poetry and published work, please find <a href="https://ivanzhao.me/about" target=_blank>here</a>.

const answer4 = `<p>I've worked on a magazine called kernel which was cocreated with 20 other artists, designers and writers. 
I have partaken in many local programming in san francisco, including but not limited to partnerships with local comics work, the Letterform Archive, and the SF Public Library in creating work that's presented to the community.</p>`;
